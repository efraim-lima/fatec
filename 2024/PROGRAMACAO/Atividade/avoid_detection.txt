Avoiding detection and blocks while scraping websites can be challenging, but there are several techniques you can employ to reduce the likelihood of being detected:

Use a Headless Browser: Tools like Selenium or Puppeteer allow you to automate browser actions. By using a headless browser, you can mimic human-like behavior, including mouse movements, clicks, and keystrokes, which can make your scraper less detectable.
Rotate IP Addresses: Frequent requests from the same IP address can trigger rate limiting or bans. Using a rotating proxy service can help you switch IP addresses regularly, making it harder for the website to detect and block your scraper.
Randomize User-Agent Headers: Websites often analyze user-agent strings to identify bots and scrapers. By randomizing the user-agent header in your HTTP requests, you can make your scraper appear more like a regular browser.
Emulate Human Behavior: Mimic human behavior by introducing random delays between requests, clicking on random elements, and scrolling through pages. This can make your scraper appear more natural and less likely to trigger detection mechanisms.
Avoid Aggressive Scraping: Limit the rate of your requests to the target website to avoid overloading their servers. Respect the website's robots.txt file, which specifies which pages should not be crawled.
Use CAPTCHA Solving Services: Some websites use CAPTCHAs to prevent automated scraping. You can integrate CAPTCHA solving services into your scraper to bypass these challenges.
Session Management: Maintain session state and handle cookies effectively to simulate returning users. This can help you bypass detection mechanisms that rely on session tracking.
Monitor Website Changes: Regularly check if the website's structure or anti-scraping measures have changed. Adapt your scraper accordingly to avoid detection.
Legal Considerations: Ensure that your scraping activities comply with the website's terms of service and relevant laws. Some websites explicitly prohibit scraping in their terms of service, and violating these terms could lead to legal consequences.
